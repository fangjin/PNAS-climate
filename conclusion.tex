we build a climate prorest classifer based on the logistc linear regression model, which achieves the best performance comparing with other classical classifiers. We analysis the climate related protest both temporally and geographically. Further more, we investigate the cliamte protest causilities, and show that the shortage of water and electicity tops the climate protests. Finally, we aslo demostrate the climate protests patterns.
